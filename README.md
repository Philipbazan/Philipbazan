Hey there! I'm Philip Bazan, an experienced Accounts Payable Specialist/Staff Accountant Consultant with a passion for diving into data and uncovering insights. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in financial operations in diverse industries, I've developed a keen eye for detail and a knack for solving accounts payable problems.

Transitioning into the exciting world of Business Intelligence and Data Analysis, I'm on a mission to leverage my analytical skills and domain knowledge to drive informed decision-making.

I hold a solid foundation in finance with a Bachelors in Business Finance from Cal State Fullerton, complemented by rigorous self-study and formal education in BI/Data Analysis while enrolled in the Business Intelligence Analyst Program at Tripleten Academy. My journey into this field has been fueled by continuous learning and hands-on projects:

•	Excel: Proficient in creating dynamic financial models, automating reports, and conducting data analysis using advanced formulas and VBA macros. (See My project on NYC Rental Investment Opportunity Analysis)

•	SQL: Skilled in querying databases to extract, transform, and analyze data efficiently. Experienced in writing complex SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.

•	Tableau: Proficient in designing interactive dashboards and visualizations to present data-driven insights effectively. (See my interactive Dashboard on Product Returns Analysis for a large superstore)

•	Power BI: Experienced in building interactive reports and dashboards, transforming raw data into actionable insights using Power Query and DAX.

In my GitHub repositories, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my expertise in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. From financial data analysis to interactive visualizations, each project reflects my dedication to mastering these tools and applying them to real-world scenarios.
