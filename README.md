Hi there! I’m Philip Bazan, a Business Intelligence Analyst with a strong foundation in financial operations and a keen enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making. With over five years in accounts payable and financial analysis, I’ve honed an analytical mindset and a deep attention to detail—skills I’m now channeling toward uncovering actionable insights for businesses.

I'm transitioning into Business Intelligence with a Bachelor’s in Business Finance from Cal State Fullerton and recent completion of the Business Intelligence Analyst Program at Tripleten Academy (2024). This formal education, coupled with my self-driven projects, has equipped me with expertise in Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.

In my GitHub repositories, you’ll find various projects demonstrating my analytical skills and technical proficiency, each crafted to showcase my commitment to the BI field.
